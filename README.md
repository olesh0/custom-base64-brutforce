## base64 custom table based encryption

##### how does it work?

All we do is just randomize default base64 table, so then your randomized table is your key with which you can encode/decode your data.


##### Basic usage

run `python3 main.py` and you'll see a menu with all possible options such as: encode/decode/brutforce


****

FYI: For now brutforce works a little stupid (just random values with no step by step logic, but we'll fix that)
